    <h1>Rebase</h1>

    <h3>Workspace</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Line 1 tim</li>
        <li>Line 2</li>
        <li>Line 3 tim</li>
        <li>Line 4</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>A create branch "rebase-A" based on "master"</li>
        <li>B Create another branch "rebase-B" based on "master"</li>
        <li>A modify line 1 and commit</li>
        <li>B modify line 2 and commit</li>
        <li>A modify line 3 and commit</li>
        <li>B modify line 4 and commit</li>
        <li>
            A merge "rebase-B" to his branch
            <pre>git merge rebase-B</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            B rebase his branch with "rebase-A"
            <pre>git rebase rebase-A</pre>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    What's the difference? B should see his 2 commits on top while A should see his commit history mixed up with B commit in real time
